In this project, we will be working on an audio dataset, which consists of normal breathinga and asthmatic breathing. We want classify the audios into their respective classes by converting each audio to a signal, and extracting topological features using different methods. These methods include Persistent Entropy, various metrics such as bottleneck, heat, and Betti numbers, as well as Carlsson Coordinates.
